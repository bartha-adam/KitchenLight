# KitchenLight
Motion detection based light control done with Arduino.

### Components:
- Arduino Nano
- L298N
- 50k potentiometer
- PIR HC-SR501 motion sensor
- BH1750FVI light intensity sensor
- L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Controller
- 12V 3A Power supply
- 2 and 3 pins screw connectors

### Build instructions:
 In order to build the code using Arduino IDE, install the [BH1750](https://github.com/claws/BH1750) library by claws

 See BH1750 github homepage for details.
 
 ### PCB
 
 PCB was designed with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)
 Feel free to update/improve the PCB design or suggest improvements, but don't blame me, it's my first PCB design :)
 
 Used blue pnp sheets to transfer the circuit and I think, the result was acceptable...
